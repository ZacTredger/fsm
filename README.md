# Finite State Machine Designer

Originally by @evanw (http://madebyevan.com/fsm/). This is an attempt to modernize the codebase, migrate to a node.js-based build system and to expand the application with new features.

## How to build

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`

Run `npm run dev` to start the webpack development server, and then navigate to http://localhost:8080.
